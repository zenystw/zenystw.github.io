Therefore, I had to resolve conflicts and optimize development while ensuring compatibility among all these plugins.","The client places strong emphasis on user experience and brand consistency. Their designer provided responsive mockups for each page, expecting every layout to be implemented faithfully according to the design."],"continuations":["Since I began working on this project, the website has undergone over twenty major and minor updates. To overcome these challenges and meet the client's expectations, I thoroughly studied the WordPress backend architecture and became well-versed in the functionality of dozens of plugins used across the site.","Thanks to the client's appreciation and a recommendation from my former supervisor, this website continued to be entrusted to me even after I left the company, until July 2024, when I stepped down due to time constraints."],"note":"As of {date}, the site remains largely unchanged — almost every visible page was developed by me."},"lineBot":{"name":"Vocabulary Helper","introductions":["This bot was a personal project for practicing LINE Bot development and Python web scraping.
